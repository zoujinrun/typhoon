Fetch the numbers once, save the raw reply to data/, and never fetch again.

    uv run fetch.py

Change URL and FILE. The default is the Hong Kong Observatory's daily mean
temperature for 2026, so the template runs before you have touched it and you
can see what a file looks like when it arrives. It is an example, not your
phenomenon: handing it in unchanged is handing in nothing.
